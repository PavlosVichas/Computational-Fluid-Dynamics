# Computational-Fluid-Dynamics
“Academic assignments focus on low-level CFD using numerical methods, differential equations, and coding, without relying on commercial softwares


1️⃣ **Assignment 1:** Development of the **boundary layer** 🌊 — exploring how fluid behaves near surfaces.  
2️⃣ **Assignment 2:** **Lid-driven cavity benchmark** 🌀 — a classic test to check numerical accuracy and stability in confined flows.
